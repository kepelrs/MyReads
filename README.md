# MyReads Project

This is the Udacity's Nanodegree MyReads React Project. This is a simple app with which you can keep track of your book reading by placing your books on three different shelves shelves: "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read".

The course provided some static code and styling, my job was to make this dynamic by using React and connecting to an API.

## Running the Project

To run this project in your system:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The provided backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
